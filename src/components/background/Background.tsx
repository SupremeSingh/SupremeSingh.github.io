          am passionate about creating something new in areas that interest me,
          and I lose track of time improvising on the drums, writing craft
          essays, making a new smart contract, structuring a workout or even
          finding a new trail to hike on.

          Having had the time to introspect over COVID, I donâ€™t define myself

          than that. To find my fullest potential while balancing the many
          colors of life. Be it behind a screen or in a forest. Chasing success
          or trying to help others.
